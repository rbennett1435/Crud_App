# Persistence - Command Line CRUD

This project is a persistent CRUD app that I made for my class. It is designed to store games that the user puts in, and keep track of the status and genre.

# Why?

I decided to make this because I enjoy video games. As someone who plays a lot of them, it gets hard to keep track of the one that I am going through. I made it so people who play games have an easier time keeping track of the games they're playing through.
